## Introduction
Running is a great way to get fit, feel better and even form new relationships with other runners. Starting a new running habit doesn’t have to be hard — all it takes is a comfortable pair of shoes and a willingness to move a little or a lot, all at your own pace. However, the absolute best way to keep yourself running is to find a race, sign up for it, pay for it and put it on your calendar. A fixed race date will help you stay focused, and keep you on a regular running schedule. A beginner can run any race — you just need to allow enough time to train for it. Pick your distance and start a training plan. After the 5 km, the second-most popular race is the half-marathon (21.1 km). Half-marathons are great races for beginners because — like the marathon — you get the thrill of a big race event but you have to go only half the distance. Training for a half-marathon isn’t much different than training for a full one, though. You’ll need to be dedicated to your goal, but crossing that finish line will be you feel an indescribable emotion.
