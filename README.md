# Half-Marathon Training Analysis
* Create a tool that estimates half-marathon effort to help amateurs runners reach the goal to finish the race below 2 hours.
* Search and aplly API connected to Strava using python.
* Examine the data for distribution, outliers and anomalies to direct the hypothesis formulation.
* Provide tools for hypothesis generation by visualizing and understanding the data through graphical representation.
* Build Machine-learning models.
* Evaluate and optimize to reach the best model. 

## Introduction
Running is a great way to get fit, feel better and even form new relationships with other runners. Starting a new running habit doesn’t have to be hard — all it takes is a comfortable pair of shoes and a willingness to move a little or a lot, all at your own pace. However, the absolute best way to keep yourself running is to find a race, sign up for it, pay for it and put it on your calendar. A fixed race date will help you stay focused, and keep you on a regular running schedule. A beginner can run any race — you just need to allow enough time to train for it. Pick your distance and start a training plan. After the 5 km, the second-most popular race is the half-marathon (21.1 km). Half-marathons are great races for beginners because — like the marathon — you get the thrill of a big race event but you have to go only half the distance. Training for a half-marathon isn’t much different than training for a full one, though. You’ll need to be dedicated to your goal, but crossing that finish line will be you feel an indescribable emotion.

## Scope
**Estimar se um corredor amador vai completar sua meia maratona abaixo de 2h com base nos seus treinos.**

## Dataset
Strava is a social media and fitness-tracking app that's tailored for runners and cyclists. The app can help you connect with other people in your area who share your fitness interests and even discover local clubs and athletic challenges. **O conjunto de dados usados nesse projeto são retirados das minhas atividades monitoradas através do meu relógio Garmin e submetidas à minha conta Strava.com/athletes/21632037**
